            "EXAMPLE_READING" => "A trip to Alaska
            Alaska is an extraordinary place. It’s the biggest state in the USA – it has North America’s highest mountain
            and the world’s most dramatic glaciers. In fact nothing in Alaska is small. Even the people are big!
            The population of Alaska is just 610,000. Some people, like the Inuits, live in Arctic villages hundreds of
            kilometres from the nearest town. Other Alaskans live in small cities like Anchorage and Juneau. In places
            like Anchorage everybody has a car, but they also have a plane. There aren’t any roads outside the cities, so
            flying is the only way you can travel. Many people have boat planes, and lakes near towns and cities often
            look like plane car parks.
            One of the most famous places in Alaska is the Denali National Park. The park is one of the most beautiful
            nature reserves in the world, and you can only get there by private plane. Pilots usually land on a riverbank
            and leave you there. Then they pick you up at the same time, in the same place a few days later!
            Alaska is also famous for being cold. The lowest temperature ever recorded was
            -80 ̊ C! It’s also dark. There isn’t much sunlight during winter, although you can see red, green, and blue
            ‘Northern Lights’ in the sky.
            Many tourists visit Alaska in the spring and summer. Few tourists go in winter. From November to
            February, Alaska is so cold that planes often get ‘weathered in’ and can’t fly. Winter holidays in Alaska can
            be longer than you planned!",

            "EXAMPLE_READING" => "Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American
            singer and actor. A cultural icon, he is commonly known by the single name
            Elvis. One of the most popular musicians of the 20th century, he is often
            referred to as the 'King of Rock and Roll' or 'the King'.
            Born in Tupelo, Mississippi, Presley moved to Memphis, Tennessee, with his
            family at the age of 13. He began his career there in 1954, working with Sun
            Records owner Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of AfricanAmerican music to a wider audience. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore
            and bassist Bill Black, Presley was the most important popularizer of rockabilly.
            RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker,
            who went on to manage the singer for over two decades. Presley's first RCA
            single, 'Heartbreak Hotel”, released in January 1956, was a number-one hit. He
            became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll with a
            series of network television appearances and chart-topping records. His
            energized interpretations of songs, many from African-American sources, and
            his uninhibited performance style made him enormously popular—and
            controversial. In November 1956, he made his film debut in Love Me Tender.
            Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career
            two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He staged
            few concerts however, and, guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the
            1960s to making Hollywood movies and soundtrack albums, most of them
            critically derided.
            Presley's only child, Lisa Marie, was born on February 1, 1968, during a period
            when he had grown deeply unhappy with his career. In 1968, after seven years
            away from the stage, he returned to live performance in a celebrated comeback
            television.
            Recorded in late June in Burbank, California, the special, called simply Elvis,
            aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the '68 Comeback Special, the
            show featured studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in
            front of a small audience—Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live
            segments saw Presley clad in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in a
            style reminiscent of his early rock-and-roll days. In 1973 Presley staged the first
            concert broadcast globally via satellite, Aloha from Hawaii.
            Presley's divorce took effect on October 9, 1973. He was now becoming
            increasingly unwell. Twice during the year he overdosed on barbiturates,
            spending three days in a coma in his hotel suite after the first incident. Toward
            the end of 1973, he was hospitalized, because of the effects of Demerol
            addiction. Prescription drug abuse severely deteriorated his health, and he died
            suddenly in 1977 at the age of 42.
            Presley's funeral was held at Graceland, on Thursday, August 18.
            Approximately 80,000 people lined the processional route to Forest Hill
            Cemetery, where Presley was buried next to his mother. Within a few days,
            'Way Down' topped the country and UK pop charts.
            Presley is regarded as one of the most important figures of 20th-century popular
            culture. He had a versatile voice and unusually wide success encompassing
            many genres, including country, pop ballads, gospel, and blues. He is the bestselling solo artist in the history of popular music. Nominated for 14 competitive
            Grammys, he won three, and received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement
            Award at age 36. He has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.",
